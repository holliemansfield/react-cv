    "bio":"I am a determined person with strong empathetic, organisational and communication skills. I am currently employed at Monzo within the second line of defence as a Senior Operational Risk Manager - working primarily with Payments, Third Party Risk Management and Finance. I am critical of my own progress while consistently driving to learn more, most recently challenging myself to expand my technical knowledge in SQL, Python3 and React. I have completed both my CertIRM in Risk Management in Financial Services, and an  ICA certificate in AML (distinction). I was born in Northern Ireland but grew up travelling; spending the bulk of my childhood in Kenya, East Africa. Whilst travelling, I was able to widen my outlook on life, develop my cross-cultural competencies and adaptibility. This also developed a large passion for animal conservation and illegal wildlife trafficking.",
